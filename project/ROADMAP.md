## 2. Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

This phase focuses on delivering the core functionality of the Headcase application, providing a complete end-to-end flow for device registration and approval.

-   **Device Request Form:** A simple web form for users to request access for a new device.
-   **Admin Dashboard:** A dashboard for administrators to view and manage pending requests.
-   **Inline Approval/Rejection:** The ability for an admin to approve or reject requests directly from the dashboard without a page reload.
-   **Dynamic QR Code Display:** Upon approval, a pre-auth key and a scannable QR code will be displayed dynamically in the dashboard.

## 3. Phase 2: Security & Polish

This next major phase of work focuses on hardening the security of the application and improving its overall robustness for production use.

-   **Admin Authentication:** Implement a secure login system to protect the admin dashboard.
-   **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensure the application is served over HTTPS, likely via a reverse proxy like Caddy.
-   **Pre-Auth Key Expiration:** Enforce time limits and single-use rules on generated pre-auth keys to enhance security.

## 4. Phase 3: UX & Advanced Features

Beyond the core functionality and security, this phase focuses on improving the user experience and adding advanced features for power users.

-   **Notifications:** Implement email or WebSocket notifications to alert admins of new device requests.
-   **Bulk Actions:** Allow admins to approve or reject multiple requests at once.
-   **Mobile-Friendly UI Enhancements:** Further refine the responsive design for an optimal experience on mobile and tablet devices.
-   **Logging & Auditing:** Add more detailed logging and an audit trail for administrative actions.
